# Public_Scripts
Scripts available for anyone in the public to read for maximum transparency

The Office of Energy Policy pulls data from a wide variety of sources to create publications, interactive dashboards, and answer questions for the public and decision makers. The scripts included in this repository have been formatted so that they will run to completion with minimum effort on the part of the reader. However, there are two things you will need to do should you want the script to run to completion and output a file. 

1) For any script that pulls from an API, you will need to register with the relevant website and get an API key. Then substitute it in for the key variable created in         each script. 
2) Uncomment any lines that output a file to a directory. They will be write.csv() commands that have been cleared for your convenience. 
      
 If you have any questions or concerns about the scripts you read here or any other energy-related questions, please don't hesitate to email me at greg.bone@ky.gov
